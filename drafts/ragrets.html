    <p>A while back Swift developer Joe Groff <a href="https://twitter.com/jckarter/status/1084993677561196545">tweeted a
proposal</a> that projects have a
REGRETS.MD file describing "regretful design choices that can't be reversed for time,
compatibility, etc. reasons." This seems like a good idea, both to help developers who are
trodding similar ground, and also for me to vent some frustration with being unable to rewind
time.</p>
<p>To that end, I'm starting a blog series, RAGRETS.MD, where I will list some of the design
decisions I regret about C#. For the most part these are my personal regrets, but in cases where
I know the feeling is shared widely among the language or development teams I'll do my best to
point it out.</p>
<p>To christen the series I might as well start with one of the most universally reviled "features"
in the C# language: covariant arrays. Everyone I know of in the language and the development
teams who has an opinion on the feature thinks it's bad.</p>
<p>For those unfamiliar, the feature is simple: in C# an array of type <code>T[]</code> can be converted to an
array of type <code>U[]</code> if <code>U</code> is a subtype of <code>T</code>. For instance, an array of <code>string[]</code> can be
converted to an array of type <code>object[]</code> without copying the array. As far as I know, there are
two reasons the feature was put into C#. The first is simple; Java has it. C# was meant to be
familiar to Java users and reasonably compatible with its source code. The second reason is
probably the reason why Java has it: it's quite useful if your language doesn't have generics.</p>
<p>Consider how you would write a simple helper method to print an array of objects without
generics. It would probably look something like:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">void</span> <span class="nf">PrintAll</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">object</span><span class="p">[]</span> <span class="n">objects</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="k">foreach</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">var</span> <span class="n">o</span> <span class="k">in</span> <span class="n">objects</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="n">Console</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">WriteLine</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">o</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">ToString</span><span class="p">());</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>


<p>This seems like a very useful method, but what if you want to use it to print a list of strings? If
there's a conversion from <code>string[]</code> to <code>object[]</code>, no problem. But if there isn't you have to copy
the whole list. It's pretty easy to see why covariant arrays are attractive.</p>
<p>So what's the problem? Well, the first problem is that it's completely type-unsafe given that arrays
are mutable. Consider the following example:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="kt">string</span><span class="p">[]</span> <span class="n">s</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="k">new</span><span class="p">[]</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="s">&quot;a&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">&quot;b&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">&quot;c&quot;</span> <span class="p">};</span>
<span class="kt">object</span><span class="p">[]</span> <span class="n">o</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="n">s</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="n">o</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="m">0</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="m">5</span><span class="p">;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>This should fail at compile time -- you're putting an integer into a string array! Indeed, if you
replace <code>o[0]</code> with <code>s[0]</code> on the last line, you'll get a compile time error saying this is
illegal. But covariant arrays violate compile-time type safety. Of course, C# is supposed to be a
memory safe language, so it doesn't just do nothing about this. Instead it adds a <em>runtime</em> check
to every write of an array, <em>just in case</em> there's a type safety violation, at which point an
exception is thrown.</p>
<p>The second problem is that array covariance is just not that useful if you have interfaces and
generics that understand variance. Later versions of C# added generics and variance to interfaces
like <code>IEnumerable&lt;T&gt;</code>, which is a simple, type safe approach to writing the <code>PrintAll</code> method
above. The key is that <code>IEnumerable&lt;T&gt;</code> doesn't allow modification of the elements of the array,
so you can never alter the array after the conversion.</p>
<p>So the sum of the situation is: any array write could potentially throw an exception and all
array accesses suffer a performance hit, just for a feature that almost no one uses and has
clearly better alternatives.</p>
